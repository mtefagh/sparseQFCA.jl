"""
    quantomeReducer(model)

The function is designed to perform metabolic network reduction by removing blocked reactions, merge all the fully coupled reactions,
remove the eligible reactions by the DCE-induced reductions.It extracts relevant data, separates reversible and irreversible reactions,
corrects reversibility, and removes zero rows from the stoichiometric matrix. It processes flux coupling analysis to identify reaction
clusters and reactions to be removed. The function constructs a reduced metabolic network matrix and performs distributed optimization
for DCE-induced reductions. Finally, it generates information about the reduction process and returns the reduced metabolic network matrix.

# INPUTS

- `model`:                     A CanonicalModel that has been built using COBREXA's `load_model` function.

# OPTIONAL INPUTS

- `SolverName`:                Name of the solver(default: HiGHS).
- `OctuplePrecision`:          A flag(default: false) indicating whether octuple precision should be used when solving linear programs.
- `removing`:                  A flag controlling whether reactions should be filtered out during the coupling determination phase of network analysis.
- `Tolerance`:                 A small number that represents the level of error tolerance.
- `printLevel`:                Verbose level (default: 1). Mute all output with `printLevel = 0`.

# OUTPUTS

- `reducedModel`               A reduced metabolic network.

# EXAMPLES

- Full input/output example
```julia
julia> reducedModel = quantomeReducer(model)
