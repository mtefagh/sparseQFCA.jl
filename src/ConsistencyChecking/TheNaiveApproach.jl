    find_blocked_reactions(model)

The function identifies blocked reactions in a metabolic model. Blocked reactions are reactions that cannot carry any flux,
i.e., the flux through the reaction is zero, due to the stoichiometry of the model and the constraints on the reaction rates.
The function first homogenizes the bounds on the reaction rates, and then identifies blocked irreversible reactions by optimizing
the flux through each reaction while constraining the flux to be less than or equal to 1. If the optimal flux is approximately zero,
the reaction is considered blocked. Then, the function identifies blocked reversible reactions by optimizing the flux through each
reaction in both directions, forward and backward, while constraining the flux to be less than or equal to 1 in the forward direction
and greater than or equal to -1 in the backward direction. If the optimal flux in both directions is approximately zero,the reaction
is considered blocked. The function returns the IDs of the blocked reactions.

# INPUTS

- `model`:              A CoreModel that has been built using COBREXA's `load_model` function.

# OPTIONAL INPUTS

- `Tolerance`:          A small number that represents the level of error tolerance.
- `printLevel`:         Verbose level (default: 1). Mute all output with `printLevel = 0`.

# OUTPUTS

- `blocked_index`:      IDs of of blocked reactions.

# EXAMPLES

- Full input/output example
```julia
julia> blocked_index = find_blocked_reactions(model)
```
